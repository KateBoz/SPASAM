abstract = {Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) is considered to be overfished, but the status of its populations has been debated, partly because of uncertainties regarding the effects of mixing on fishing grounds. A better understanding of spatial structure and mixing may help fisheries managers to successfully rebuild populations to sustainable levels while maximizing catches. We formulate a new seasonally and spatially explicit fisheries model that is fitted to conventional and electronic tag data, historic catch-at-age reconstructions, and otolith microchemistry stock-composition data to improve the capacity to assess past, current, and future population sizes of Atlantic bluefin tuna. We apply the model to estimate spatial and temporal mixing of the eastern (Mediterranean) and western (Gulf of Mexico) populations, and to reconstruct abundances from 1950 to 2008. We show that western and eastern populations have been reduced to 17{\%} and 33{\%}, respectively, of 1950 spawning stock biomass levels. Overfishing to below the biomass that produces maximum sustainable yield occurred in the 1960s and the late 1990s for western and eastern populations, respectively. The model predicts that mixing depends on season, ontogeny, and location, and is highest in the western Atlantic. Assuming that future catches are zero, western and eastern populations are predicted to recover to levels at maximum sustainable yield by 2025 and 2015, respectively. However, the western population will not recover with catches of 1750 and 12,900 tonnes (the "rebuilding quotas") in the western and eastern Atlantic, respectively, with or without closures in the Gulf of Mexico. If future catches are double the rebuilding quotas, then rebuilding of both populations will be compromised. If fishing were to continue in the eastern Atlantic at the unregulated levels of 2007, both stocks would continue to decline. Since populations mix on North Atlantic foraging grounds, successful rebuilding policies will benefit from trans-Atlantic cooperation.},

abstract = {Fish populations and fishing efforts in most fisheries exhibit spatial heterogeneity. However, spatial considerations are generally ignored in fishery stock assessment and management because of a lack of spatially explicit data and poor understanding of the spatial dynamics of most fisheries. This study uses a simulation approach to evaluate the consequences of misspecifying spatial structure and migration during the assessment process. We developed an operating model to simulate a fishery using US Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) as our model species. This population consists of two well-defined spawning substocks distributed and mixed in four management areas. Simulations were done for three alternative “true” populations, each having a different spatial structure both biologically and with regard to the geographic distribution of fishing effort. Stock assessments were then performed for the three simulated “true” populations using standard methodologies and assumptions currently used. Management-area...},

abstract = {Spatial homogeneity is the exception, not the rule, for many marine populations. Data limitations or biological knowledge gaps, though, often drive the assumption of limited stock structuring; the subsequent mismatch of model spatial scale and biological stock structure may compromise management goals. Spatial considerations thus remain a major challenge in providing managers with the best information for responsible and responsive management. This study uses simulation testing to offer a quantitative evaluation of spatial stock structure assumptions on the performance of stock assessments relative to management scales. Catch histories, not biological differences, are used to create stock structure. Simulation testing is based on an operating model of 'true' population states of nature that vary only in catch history across 9 regions. Stock assessments under various data scenarios are then performed on regions either as one aggregated assessment, or at finer area scales defined by zonal catch differences. The median absolute relative error of the terminal spawning biomass depletion is used as a performance statistic. One area stock assessments demonstrated low bias and high precision under all catch scenarios when stock structure is ignored, but perform poorly when applied to areas with differing regional catch histories. Separate area assessments grouped by zonal catch differences performed best under these circumstances, despite lower data quality, indicating the importance of identifying stock structure for management purposes. We suggest a focus on explicitly defining management units prior to conducting stock assessments with a concomitant resolve to increase data provisions at the resolution of management needs. ?? 2010.},

@article{Hutchinson2008,
abstract = {The plight of the marine fisheries is attracting increasing attention as unsustainably high exploitation levels, exacerbated by more extreme climatic conditions, are driving stocks to the point of collapse. The North Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), a species which until recently formed a major component of the demersal fisheries, has undergone significant declines across its range. The North Sea stock is typical of many, with a spawning stock biomass that has remained below the safe biological limit since 2000 and recruitment levels near the lowest on record. Cod within the North Sea are currently managed as a single stock, and yet mounting empirical evidence supports the existence of a metapopulation of regionally variable, genetically distinct, sub-stocks. Applying the same management strategies to multiple stocks that differ in their resilience to exploitation inevitably results in the overfishing and likely collapse of the weaker components. Indeed, recent studies have identified two North Sea spawning stocks that have undergone disproportionally large collapses with very substantial reductions in egg production. Similarly affected cod stocks in the northwest Atlantic have shown little evidence of recovery, despite fishery closures. The possible implications of ignoring sub-structuring within management units for biocomplexity, local adaptation and ecosystem stability are considered.},

abstract = {The conclusions drawn from fisheries stock assessment models can depend strongly on the relative weights assigned to different data sets. However, there is no consensus amongst practitioners as to the best approach to data weighting. From a discussion of some key questions concerning data weighting in stock assessment models, I draw three guiding principles: (i) do not let other data stop the model from fitting abundance data well; (ii) when weighting age or length composition data, allow for correlations; and (iii) do not down-weight abundance data because they may be unrepresentative. I propose an approach to data weighting based on these principles. Two factors that complicate this approach are that some decisions are inevitably subjective (which underlines the need for expert knowledge in stock assessment), and some technical problems are unresolved.},

In this study, we investigate the feasibil- ity of estimating movement using spatially disaggregated data supplemented by tagging data. Monte Carlo simulation was used to test accuracy and variability of parameter estimation in model scenarios with and without tagging information. Total biomass estimates for models with and without tagging data were unbiased, but uncertainty was smaller when tagging data were available. Uncertainty was also reduced in regional biomass and movement parameters when including tagging data. Our findings indicate that tagging information would be important to provide reliable spatially explicit fisheries management advice for eastern Bering Sea pollock.},

abstract = {Simulation models are useful and flexible tools that can be used to synthesize information gained from multiple stock identification methods. The assimilation of information from many sources into a population dynamics model can provide a holistic view of stock structure. Application of spatially explicit models within the simulation framework allows the testing of varying hypotheses regarding stock structure and connectivity. Additionally, using this approach we can examine the ecological, assessment, and management implications of complex spatial structure for the fish resource. This chapter summarizes the simulation modeling framework and how it can be applied to investigate population structure. We highlight how stock identification data can be incorporated into simulations and review recent advances in spatial modeling techniques. We conclude with a discussion of seminal case studies, which illustrate how simulation models have impacted our understanding of stock structure in fish populations. Ultimately, simulation models have many limitations because they are simplified abstractions of large and complex natural systems. However, when carefully vetted and used with strict adherence to the scientific method, simulations can be powerful and invaluable tools for examining spatial population structure. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This paper deals with the design of modelling tools suitable for investigating the consequences of alternative policies on the dynamics of resources and fisheries, such as the evaluation of marine protected areas (MPA). We first review the numerous models that have been developed for this purpose, and compare them from several standpoints: population modelling, exploitation modelling and management measure modelling. We then present a generic fisheries simulation model, Integration of Spatial Information for FISHeries simulation (ISIS-Fish). This spatially explicit model allows quantitative policy screening for fisheries with mixed-species harvests. It may be used to investigate the effects of combined management scenarios including a variety of policies: total allowable catch (TAC), licenses, gear restrictions, MPA, etc. Fisher's response to management may be accounted for by means of decision rules conditioned on population and exploitation parameters. An application to a simple example illustrates the relevance of this kind of tool for policy screening, particularly in the case of mixed fisheries. Finally, the reviewed models and ISIS-Fish are discussed and confronted in the light of the underlying assumptions and model objectives. In the light of this discussion, we identify desirable features for fisheries simulation models aimed at policy evaluation, and particularly MPA evaluation.},

abstract = {Ignorance of spatial structures in fisheries management may lead to unexpected risks of overexploitation. Based on the information about small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) off the coast of China, we simulated a fish population consisting of three subpopulations mixing at intermediate levels, which was considered in the true spatial structure of the population in this study. Three scenarios of population spatial structure were assumed in assessing and managing this simulated fishery: (i) metapopulation, which has the same structure as the true population; (ii) three independent subpopulations, which overlook the exchanges among the subpopulations; and (iii) unit population, which completely ignores the population spatial structure. Corresponding approaches were applied to assess and manage each of these assumed fish populations. The management time period was assumed to be 10 years with two harvesting levels (i.e., maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and f0.1). Assessing and managing the metapopulation as several independent populations could lead to a high probability of overexploitation. Managing the metapopulation as a unit population could lead to local depletion. Use of MSY as a management target may be risk prone in the existence of a metapopulation, and use of a fishing mortality lower than f0.1 as a management target is more desirable.},

abstract = {Based on previous work, dome-shaped fishery selectivity patterns are expected in place of asymptotic patterns when one-way fish movements among areas are considered. It is less clear if this occurs when the “round-trip” seasonal movements are considered. A simulation of a long-distance migrating fish stock (Atlantic menhaden) was used to study the influence of life history and fishery processes on selectivity, under an “areas as fleet” stock assessment context. When age-constant two-way migration was assumed to occur at a low rate, a domed selectivity pattern in the area ex-periencing the highest fishing mortality was produced, consistent with previous work. However, as the two-way migration rate increased, the domed selectivity pattern diminished and eventually disappeared. When age-varying migration was introduced, with a higher movement prob-ability for older fish, domed selectivity prevailed in the source (i.e. spawning) area. If movement away from the spawning area occurs at younger ages than are selected by the fishing gear, the extent of the dome in this area is reduced. When movement away from the spawning area occurs at ages that are already available to the fishing gear, the dome in the spawning area is exaggerated. The area in which domed selectivity occurred was primarily determined by whether the probability of movement increased or decreased with age. In contrast to previous work that considered one-way or diffusive movement, the temporal or spatial distribution of recruitment and overall fishing mortality did not have a signifi-cant influence on selectivity. Building simulations that reflect the life history of the stock can guide assessment efforts by placing priors and con-straints on model fits to selectivity patterns and be used to explore trade-offs between model complexity and the ability to produce reasonable management advice. Their development is encouraged as a standard feature in the assessment of migratory fish stocks.},

Bias in some aggregated model scenarios could be attributed to unaccounted-for process errors in annual fishing mortality rates and was reduced when estimating effective sample size or time-varying selectivity. Spatially explicit models that allow estimation of variability in movement and ontogenetic parameters (specified as a random walk process) were shown to be feasible, whereas models that misspecified ontogenetic movement and climate change effects resulted in biased biomass and movement parameter estimates. These results illustrate that more complex models may characterize processes better but may be less robust for management advice. R{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}:},

abstract = {The frequently observed positive relationship between fish population abundance and spatial distribution suggests that changes in distribution can be indicative of trends in abundance. If contractions in spatial distribution precede declines in spawning stock biomass (SSB), spatial distribution reference points could complement the SSB reference points that are commonly used in marine conservation biology and fisheries management. When relevant spatial distribution information is integrated into fisheries management and recovery plans, risks and uncertainties associated with a plan based solely on the SSB criterion would be reduced. To assess the added value of spatial distribution data, we examine the relationship between SSB and four metrics of spatial distribution intended to reflect changes in population range, concentration, and density for 10 demersal populations (9 species) inhabiting the Scotian Shelf, Northwest Atlantic. Our primary purpose is to assess their potential to serve as indices of SSB, using fisheries independent survey data. We find that metrics of density offer the best correlate of spawner biomass. A decline in the frequency of encountering high density areas is associated with, and in a few cases preceded by, rapid declines in SSB in 6 of 10 populations. Density-based indices have considerable potential to serve both as an indicator of SSB and as spatially based reference points in fisheries management.},

abstract = {In any stock assessment application, the implicit assumptions regarding spatial population structure must be carefully$\backslash$r$\backslash$nevaluated. Tag-integrated models offer a promising approach for incorporating spatial structure and movement patterns in$\backslash$r$\backslash$nstock assessments, but the complexity of the framework makes implementation challenging and the appraisal of performance$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndifficult. A flounder-like fishery was simulated to emulate the metapopulation dynamics of the three yellowtail flounder$\backslash$r$\backslash$n(Limanda ferruginea) stocks off New England, and the robustness of spatially explicit tag-integrated models were compared with$\backslash$r$\backslash$nclosed population assessments. Different movement parametrizations and data uncertainty scenarios were simulated, while the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nability of the tag-integrated model to estimate reporting rate and time-varying movement were also evaluated. Results indicated$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthat the tag-integrated framework was robust for the simulated fishery across a wide range of connectivity levels and that tag$\backslash$r$\backslash$nreporting rates were accurately estimated. Closed population models also demonstrated limited error. Therefore, spatially$\backslash$r$\backslash$nexplicit approaches may not always be warranted even when regional connectivity is occurring, but tag-integrated models can$\backslash$r$\backslash$nprovide improved parameter estimates when reliable tagging data are available. Tag-integrated models also serve as valuable$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntools for informing spatially explicit operating models, which can then be used to evaluate the assumptions and performance of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nclosed population models.},

abstract = {Amismatch between the scale of fisherymanagement units and biological population structure can potentially result in a misperceptionof the prod- uctivity and sustainable yield of fish stocks.We used simulationmodelling as a tool to compare the perception of productivity, stability, and sustain- ability of Atlantic cod (Gadusmorhua) off NewEngland froman operatingmodel based on the currentUSmanagement units to amodel thatmore closely reflects the biological complexity of the resource. Two age-structuredmodels were compared: (i) themanagement unit model, wherein cod were grouped based on the current spatially defined US management areas (Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank), and (ii) the biological unit model, consisting of three genetically defined population components (northern spring spawning, southern winter/spring spawning, and eastern Georges Bank spring-spawning groups). Overall, the regional productivity and maximumsustainable yield of the biological unit model was lower compared with themanagement unit model. The biological unitmodel also provided insights on the distribution of productivity in the region, with southern and northern spawning groups being the dominant contributors to the regional spawning–stock biomass and yield and the eastern Georges Bank spawning group being theminority contributor at low to intermediate levels of fishingmortality. The comparison of models revealed that the per- ceptionofAtlantic codderivedfromthemanagementunitmodelwas of a resource that ismore resilient to fishingmortalityandnot as susceptible to “collapse” as indicated by the biological unitmodel. For Atlantic cod, one of themain risks of ignoring population structure appears the potential for overexploitation of segments of the population. Consideration of population structure of cod changed our perception of the magnitude and distribution of productivity in the region, suggesting that expectations of sustainable yield of cod in US waters should be reconsidered.},

abstract = {Management procedures (MPs) are becoming widely used in fisheries management, but guidelines to assist in their construction, evaluation, and implementation are few. We provide simple guidelines by drawing on experience from developing and applying MPs in southern Africa and internationally. Suggestions are provided on how to choose between candidate MPs and on key trade-offs in selecting between data-based (empirical) and model-based formulations. Assistance is also provided in dealing with differ- ent sources of uncertainty, such as deciding which operating models should be included in a reference set used for primary simulation testing and tuning (in contrast to robustness or sensitivity tests), and on how weights for the associated alternative hypotheses are most practically assigned. Finally, some guidelines are given for presenting the results effectively, which is one of the key challenges of a successful implementation process. Keywords:},

@article{Goethel2011,
abstract = {Investigations into population structure have been at the forefront of fisheries research for decades, yet it is generally ignored in stock assessment models. As the complex nature of marine population structure has been uncovered, models have attempted to accurately portray it through the development of spatially explicit assessments that allow for movement between sub-populations. Although current tag-integrated movement models are highly complex, many arose from the relatively simple models of Beverton and Holt (1957). This article traces the historical development of these models and compares their features. Originally estimation of movement utilized only tag-recapture models, but now tag-integrated assessment models incorporate several sources of fishery, survey, and tag-recapture information to inform movement estimates. As spatial management measures become more widely used, it is increasingly important that assessment models include the spatial complexities of population structure and patterns of fishery removals, in order for more reliable monitoring of population rebuilding to take place. A generalized metapopulation model is proposed for use in fisheries stock assessment, which allows for adult movement among spatially discrete sub-populations. The input requirements for the model include region-specific catch-at-age, a tag-recapture dataset, and auxiliary information, such as a fishery-independent abundance index.},
